\section*{Why This Exists}
Most "Smart Car" projects are toys. They use a simple loop (`while True: check_sensor()`) that freezes the moment the robot tries to listen or think. They use spaghetti code that makes adding a new sensor a nightmare.

Our team set out to delete the word "Toy" from the equation.

We wanted a system that could:
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Listen** while it was moving (Async Audio).
    \item **Think** without blinding itself (Threaded Vision).
    \item **Survive** a component failure (Service-Oriented Architecture).
\end{itemize}

\section*{The Hardware Reality}
We eschewed expensive, proprietary AI accelerators (like Google Coral) in favor of **Raw Compute Optimization**. By overclocking the Raspberry Pi 4 to 2.0GHz and implementing a custom "Bang-Bang" motor controller on an ESP32, we achieved real-time performance on commodity hardware.

This book is not just a report. It is a \textbf{blueprint}. It contains the exact wiring, code, and physics measurements required to replicate our work.

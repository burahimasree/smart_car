\chapter{The Vision}

\section{Motivation}
The "Smart Car" is a foundational project in robotics. However, most implementations stop at "Remote Control" or "Line Follower".
Our goal was to build an **Autonomous Agent**—a robot that you can talk to, which understands its environment, and makes decisions.

\section{Key Features}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Modal Interaction}: Voice (Input) + Display (Face) + Lights (Status).
    \item \textbf{Safety First}: Hardware-level collision prevention (ESP32).
    \item \textbf{Cloud Intelligence}: Uses Google Gemini for high-level reasoning.
    \item \textbf{Hot-Swappable Architecture}: ZMQ allows agents to crash and restart without killing the system.
\end{enumerate}
